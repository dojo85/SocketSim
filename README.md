**SocketSim** is personal WPF project

The app is meant to be used to test TCP/UDP sockets

Personal note: 
This semester (CS studies) I learned about socket programming in C# and decided to create an application with the new knowledge and combine it with a personal learning goal, to extentd my horizon and learn a bit about desktop development. To be fair, I want to mention that I was inspired by the app SocketTest (https://sourceforge.net/projects/sockettest/) and wanted to create something similar using my main programming language C#.

Leearning goals:
- Create a WPF application
- use different UI elements and controls (DockPanel, Grid, StackPanel, GroupBox)
- create and use custom styles and templates
- get more understanding of TcpClient and UdpClient
- use asynchronous programming with TcpClient and UdpClient
- OBJECTIVE UPDATE: LOGGING !!!
